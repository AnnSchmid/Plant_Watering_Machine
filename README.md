# Plant_Watering_Machine
Automated plant watering system with cloud-based monitoring and manual pump control.

## Purpose

This project aims to realize a **multi-plant watering machine**.  
Soil moisture levels are measured by individual sensors and transmitted by an **Arduino UNO R4 WiFi** to the **Arduino Cloud**, where the data is visualized.  

From the cloud dashboard, a user can press a button to activate the corresponding pump, delivering water to a specific plant.
